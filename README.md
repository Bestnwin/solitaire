# SOLITARIE : Strategic Pairing
Solitaire, also known as Patience, is a card game played by a single player. The term “Solitaire” encompasses a wide variety of games with different rules and layouts, all designed for solo play. Beyond card games, “Solitaire” can also refer to any game or activity meant to be played alone.
## What's this code about:

+ The goal is to remove all cards from play by finding specific combinations of pairs and strategically utilizing blank spaces.

## Setup:

+ A standard deck of cards is shuffled and divided into two equal halves.

+ The player selects 4-5 cards from the top of either the first or the second half.

+ The player is provided with 3-4 blank spaces to temporarily hold cards from the selected ones.

## Gameplay:

+ The player looks for pairs of cards that can be removed. A pair is valid if:

+ The cards are of the same number but different suits, or

+ The cards are of the same suit and have consecutive numbers.

+ The player can remove valid pairs from the selected cards.

+ The player may use the blank spaces to rearrange cards, aiming to create valid pairs.

+ After removing a pair, the player decides from which half to draw a new card to replace the removed ones, considering the best strategy to clear both halves.

## Winning Condition:

+ The player wins the game by successfully removing all cards from the two halves and having no cards left in hand or in the blank spaces.

+ This version of Solitaire emphasizes strategic thinking and planning to find the best combinations and sequences to win. Good luck with your game 
development!

## Things need to be  with u while performing:
+ google colab notebook(preferable)
+ some operating system

## Process:
+ Making a card of deck
+ shuffeling it
+ dividing it in 2 equal halfs
+ taking the user input to take 4 -5 cards from those half
+ performing some functions to remove or keep the cards
+ bulding a good stratergies by the user
+ making it to the end by having no more card in both the halfs and the empty list
+ showing that u have won the game

## Next 
+ I would like to solve some bugs in this code 
+ will try to add a undo option to the code
+ will make the code more presentable and easy to understand

## How to run this code:
+ open google colab notebook on the Google
+ and make a new notebook named Solitarie
+ And then copy paste the code from the file game.py to the colab notebook code cell
+ and press ctrl+enter (just run the code)
